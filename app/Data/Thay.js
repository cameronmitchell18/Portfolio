When I decided to go on this journey to learn how to code, Paige was the first to cheer me on and when I decided to go back to school for Data Analytics she selflessly picked up the slack around the house and with our dogs while I was in class or studying. None of this (or any other accomplishments in my life) would have been possible without her. I am thankful everyday that I get to spend my life with her.  ",

He has introduced me to many different frame-works and ways of working that I have implemented when building this website and other projects. I am thankful for his patience and the time he has given to me to help me along this journey. ",
